  <h1>Positioning Flowers with Mom!</h1>
  <h2>Week 3 </h2>
  <h4>9/26/15</h4>

    <p>I remember not long ago when the my mothers voice would echo through our house say "Michael Anthony how the Hell do you turn this freaking Doober(my Mother makes up word) on I want to try and do a video call." This so call Doober she speaks of is the computer and she really has no idea how to you them. She does know how to "use the Google", so as you can imagine trying to talk to her css positioning  could be  challenging.

While working(being hopelessly stuck) on this weeks positioning projects I decided to give her a call, because she has always had a gift of helping through some tough situation. "Michael so what are you trying to do with this picture on your website?" "Well Mom, I am trying to place the photo in the middle of the page to welcome people to my site." "How the hell do you do that?" Sorry I forgot to mention my mom was raised on a fishing wharf so she has the mouth like a sailor. How was I going to explain positioning to her?

I decided gardening would be a good way to explain it to her. Take your garden, it is however many fee high and wide and think of that as your web page. Now in your page you will want to have some content or flowers, and you would want to place them all in the best spot possible. Your little flowers  are in these small bio-degradable holder or a Border to hold all the dirt in. This new border creates a small area of dirt in between the flower, lets call this the Padding. Now your padding is already set up the flower(content) is in its place, you will just want to place it in the right area of the garden. You will want to adjust your Margins for the flower positing. The Margin is the space between the Border and Garden bed boundary line. You will move, shift, and reorganize the margins you make your garden look perfect, and once you have done this your design is done.

"So that is what I am trying to do with my picture on my page, position it the perfect place by adjusting the border, padding, and margins around the content."

"Michel, you could have said that ten minutes ago."
