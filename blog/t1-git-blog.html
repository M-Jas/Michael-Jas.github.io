What are the benefits of version control? Before that, what is version control?  Version Control or VC is the organizational tool for the numerous changes to the versions of  your program.
One benefit of a VC is Tracking Changes. During the progression of a project you will be making some big changes to the program; can you think back and remember all of the changes that have taken place? Most likely no and you will want some type of guidance. That is where version control will come in handy. VC gives you the capability to see every change that has happened along the way, in the project.

Another added benefit of version control is its functionality for Peer Collaboration. There is a good chance you will be working with a group of people on one project. Each person is going to have a number of things they will be adding or changing to the project, and VC is going to help organize all of this. VC allows you to see who, where, what, and why these changes have taken place.

Now what happens if you were to accidentally add a bug (error reading the program) into the program and it stops running? Don’t worry you have a rewind button. Along with seeing all of the changes in a project, the VC can actually go back to old versions and start over. Think of VC as a time machine, giving you the ability to move back and forward in time (on the program).

       Git helps to track and add these changes by using the three stages of file progression. The three different stages are changes not staged for a commit, changes to be committed, and untracked files.  Think of each one of these stages as the computers way of asking you if you are really sure you want to add these new changes to your project.

Untracked files: This stage is saying that there has been a change to a file, but it is not recognized by the system. For the computer to track these changes, you will need to run the command git add THEfile. Once this is done you can run  git status and you will see that files have moved to the next step.

Changes not staged for a commit: The computer now sees the files, but they must add to the next stage in order to add them to the project. Again, you would run  git add THEfile to put the file into the next stage. Run git status again and you will see that the file has moved.

Changes to be committed: This is the final stage of the process. Once here we will run  git commit –m “detailed short message of what was done to the file”. Running this commit command is like the save button and the -m flag is preparing the computer for you commit message . You just agreed that everything you did is what you want to add to the program and you are keeping it.

        Why use GitHub to store your code?

GitHub is a remote(not on your computer) system that allows you to add, change, and control the workflow of a project. GitHub can be seen as an additional backup to your project.

The main reason I store my code on GitHub is for its exceptional peer collaboration capabilities. GitHub allows a group to set up a project or remote repository, which will allow the entire group to work on the same project at the same time. Once people completed their changes, they will be able to add them back to the repository. The group would be able to see all the changes side by side and make additional adjustments when needed.
