    <p> Ruby Classes and The "L" </p>

<p> As many of you know in Chicago the "L" is one of the common forms of transportation, but did you know that the "L" could be considered a Class in Ruby? </p>


<p> A Class is the blueprints that form objects. In other words, each color line of the "L" (red/blue/orange/green/pink/brown/purple/yellow)  could be instances of the class. The "L" also belongs to the class of Trains, which belongs to the class of Vehicle and so on. Think of classes as trickle down effect</p>

<p> Ruby Classes use variables to define and create methods. One of these types of variables is the instance variable and they are denoted with a @before_it. An instance variable is available to use across all the methods within the class and can change for any object. The "L" could use vast amount of instance variables to define the class.  One examples could be the wheels or @wheels which could describe how the "L" moves, slows down, or stops. An additional example of an instance variable is the train line color commuters take. @line is a great example because each train line can change where it is taking you. The method would be the location you are going to "the Loop" and @line  would be for the color of the line  you would take to get there. </p>
