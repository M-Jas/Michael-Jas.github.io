      <h1>Rails?</h1>
        <p>Here we are.... Week 9 and about to enter DBC phase 1. I did not see this coming! It is safe to say that we have jammed a vast amount of crap into our heads in a very short amount of time. A fair amount of this info has been Ruby which is a object orientated language that was created over 20 years ago and has gained popularity in web development. However we never really took the time to talk about Ruby on Rails. This quick post should give you the general understanding of what Rails is all about.</p>


<p>Rails  was created in 2003 by David Heinemeier Hansson as a web application framework that is based off Ruby. The idea behind Rails is to make web development easier for the developer. Rails is set up thinking it knows everything that the developer will need to get up and running, also it should require less code.</p>


<p>Rails tend to guide its developers on a path of doing things a specific way to make programing more efficient keeping you on a somewhat strict path. Rails has two core philosophy according to rubyonrails.org, Don't Repeat Yourself and Convention over Configuration. Don't Repeat Yourself means keep the code as dry as possible, try at all cost to avoid using repetitive code in the program. Convention over Configuration means rails is set up to specific defaults of convention that will not require  you to call on them. </p>

<p>Over all Ruby on Rails was built to help guide programers into a more efficient and conventional way, that will make construction of web application vastly easier. </p>
