      <h1>Building Functions & Methonds</h1>
        <p>Recently our change from Ruby to JS has caused  some confusion with the cohort because of distinguishing the syntax differences between the functions and methods. However, I have found it's better to not look for the differences, but to look at the similarities in the differences.  In this quick rundown I plan on showing you how these Ruby methods and JS functions line up making it easier to use/learn both.</p>


<p>Setting up JS functions and Ruby methods share similar construction but not the materials.  I am referencing building materials because both the method and the function are what their languages use to contain code or series of codes that can be used many time with in the program. Please take a look at the code below to get to better look at the structure and materials.</p>


<p>What is the first thing we notice here?  Both the method and the function are declaring themselves before they can be processed. The method use "def" for Defining the method, while function uses just that "function" to set up the block of code. Moving down the line we have the name of the Function/Method is, both of which you would do the same thing to call them and use their functionality. Next , both the method and the function can take just about anything as an argument, but what if there is no argument? </p>

<p>Here is where the differences start to show more. If a method does not have a argument we don't need to have anything next to the variable name, but with the function this will not work. JS  must have the () to make the function, we would just leave them blank if there is no argument. </p>
<p>After the argument for Ruby we can start working at the code. JS is going to need one me thing before we work on the code block, we need the {}. The squiggle's can be very beneficial because the keep all of the code block with in them defining a beginning and end for the code.  The last squiggle is going to end the function, which with the ruby method we have to tell it to end with "end".</p>

<p>So going forward don't only try to look at the differences and try to see how JS and Ruby because of their structure, not the materials. </p>
