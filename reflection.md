##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned that these have a huge role in the positioning of the elements. It gives us the ability to define the spacing around elements, which will directly effect the visual outcome for the site. I never thought that there were that many layers to an element, I just figured one little box around the content.

##What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I learned that this was not easy to understand until you play with them, even then they are hard for me to grasp. I can tell you what the definitions are for block/inline-block/inline/Absolute/Relative, but I don't understand there meaning entirely. I think It's fair to say what I really learned was that I need to get a better understanding of CSS positioning. It is very conceptual and I would benefit from seeing more examples of what these each can do in action. Most of the material I found was a short two sentence explanation of what they did and do, nothing more and nothing less.


##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
Adding my profile picture! When we first started doing css everything was square, so I just needed to figured out the make it round(square peg round hole). I was expecting to spent and hour plus trying to get it set up and placed. It only took me ten minutes! The most difficult  part had to be adding navigation bars.  If my navigation bar was a person, I am not sure if I would be able to hold back my frustration and start screaming at it. Hell, I screamed at my computer anyways.
.... It didn't work.

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
 I learned from this was how to tie multiple identical sections (navigation bar or footer) across a few pages to one  CSS page. Another thing I learned was how you can manipulate the Selectors to dig deeper into your html.    Additionally I learned that there is an Efficient way to do CSS and a Ass-Backwards way to doing it. I took a nose dive down the wrong way. I spent so much time in the rabbit hole trying change the CSS to move and adjust positions.
