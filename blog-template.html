How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
I really liked it! I was able to brainstorm more and I loved the collaborative feeling. Even though these wire frames are quick rough drafts, I could see mine gaining more detail and depth with each step.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
100%! Knowing my working style I would have been all over the place trying to figure out the html skeleton. It gave me a structured guide and I just worked my way down it the site, almost like a check list.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We decided the simplicity will get you much further with usability and execution. Also the more simple a site is the cleaner and sharper it looks.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
 <nav> : or navigation is the part of the site that links other key site together such as Homepage, contact, or portfolio. <nav> is typically used in outside of the <head> and commonly found/used in the <footer>.  <footer> it defines the pages bottom section, were it could contain things links for copy writing and social media.
