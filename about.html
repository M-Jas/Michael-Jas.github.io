      <h2>Where am I From?</h2>
        <p>I was born in San Jose, Ca and lived there until the age of 4. My family relocated to the Burb's just Northwest of Chicago. I lived here until I left for college, where I attended Kansas State Univesity in Manhattan, KS. After graduation I moved back to Chicago to start my journey.</p>
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Besides being a gym rat, I really enjoy getting lost in my city. I try to make it my goal to see one new thing each day, it can be anything from building to a new pizza spot. Additioanly I love travling and would love to do more of it as soon as I can, mostly in Asia.</p>
      <h2>Professional Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal after my completion of DBC is to obtain a position where I can be a key player in the overall development of a young company. ***** To be edited  </p>
